# MyTutor

**MyTutor** is an educational tool designed to help you understand your Mathematics and Statistics.

## Background Story

With a busy schedule and limited time to thoroughly review Mathematics and Statistics, I found it challenging to keep up with the material. To address this, I developed **MyTutor**. This tool was created to simplify the learning process by providing clear explanations, practical examples, and relevant tests with solutions.

## Features

- **Explanations**: Detailed explanations of mathematical and statistical concepts.
- **Examples**: Relatable examples to help you understand the material better.
- **Mini Tests**: Customizable tests based on your content with solutions provided.

MyTutor allows me to efficiently review and understand the material, even with a packed schedule, making it easier to grasp concepts quickly and move on.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your Slides**: Upload PDF or Word documents containing your course material.
2. **Specify Page Ranges**: Indicate the page ranges you want to process (e.g. 43-46).
3. **Ask Questions**: Type any specific questions you have about the material.
4. **Get Results**: Receive explanations, examples, and mini tests with solutions.
